There's little out there for an explanation of <code:ruby>%w</code> despite its frequent use in Ruby programs and in Rails.

<pre>
<code class="ruby">%w(a b c) # ["a", "b", "c"]</code></pre>

Thats all it is, a short cut for writing out an array of strings. Also note that you can use any delimiter and not just (). For example, 

<pre><code class="ruby">%w[a b c]
%w{a b c}
</code></pre>

will both work just the same way. That allows you to make string arrays like the following: 

<pre><code class="ruby">%w[a ( c] # ["a", "(", "c"]</code></pre>

The <code>%</code> without the <code>w</code> will just make a string object. 

<pre><code class="ruby">%(a b c) # "a b c"</code></pre>

A typical use case would be 

<pre><code class="ruby"> %w(rubygems hpricot).each{|r| require r}</code></pre>
