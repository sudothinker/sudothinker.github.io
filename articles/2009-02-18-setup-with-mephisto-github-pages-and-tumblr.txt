I have a somewhat unique setup for sudothinker.com. 

I use [mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/) hosted on my [slicehost](http://slicehost.com) slice for [sudothinker.com](http://sudothinker.com), I use [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) for [beers.sudothinker.com](http://beers.sudothinker.com) and [github pages](http://pages.github.com) for [codes.sudothinker.com](http://codes.sudothinker.com). 

The reason for the 3 separate tools is so I can have the best tool for the job at hand. 

For my blog I wanted fully functional, battle tested blog software. I also wanted the flexibilty to make layout changes without code pushes. Mephisto fits this bill really well and its theme editor in the browser is pretty handy to avoid cap deploys.

For [beers.sudothinker.com](http://beers.sudothinker.com), I want a way to showcase photos easily. I normally take these photos with my iPhone and so publishing new photos is easy with the Tumblr app for the iPhone, I also get free image hosting through my tumblr account so its one hosting aspect that I don't need to worry about.

For [codes.sudothinker.com](http://codes.sudothinker.com), I wanted somewhere where I can host static pages with the flexibility of revisions, all the css/js for this site are hosted on that subdomain too. This makes it really easy to make incremental changes to the css/js files for all three domains with the flexibility of a git backend. Changes are also pushed live right away and are hosted for free on github.com. I could probably do the same with mephisto pages/sections, but this way I get to use textmate and git for editing the static pages rather than the browser.

Stay tuned for a tutorial on this kind of setup.
