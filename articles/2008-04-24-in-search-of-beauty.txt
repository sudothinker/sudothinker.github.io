title: In Search of Beauty

Even before moving to Ruby and Rails, I found myself striving for beauty and elegance in code. My constant struggles with PHP layouts, mixed with the repetitive and cumbersome nature of Java made making my code look and feel beautiful quite hard. With the move to Ruby, I find it easier and more desirable to make code beautiful. It is easier because of Ruby's syntatical elegance but why is it more desirable?

Imagine you start off with a clean sink, it will likely stay clean for a while, whenever it starts getting a little dirty and a couple of dishes end up in there - then its a downward spiral. If you arrive at a sink pilled high full of dishes - whats one more in the pile? 

The same point can be applied to writing elegant code - there is much less incentive to strive for beauty whenever the thing you are working with is already ugly. This is why writing ruby makes writing beautiful code more desirable - you are already dealing with a beautiful language with elegant syntax, and so maintaining this beauty is easier.

I would recommend watching Marcel Molina, Jr's. conference presentation on <a href="http://rubyhoedown2007.confreaks.com/session09.html">What makes code beautiful?</a>
